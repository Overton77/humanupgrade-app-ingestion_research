# MongoDB and Python Execution Rules

## MongoDB: Use AsyncMongoClient with Beanie
Do not use Motor. Always use `AsyncMongoClient` from `pymongo` with Beanie. See [biotech_research_db_beanie.py](mdc:ingestion/src/research_agent/infrastructure/storage/mongo/biotech_research_db_beanie.py) for the pattern.

## Python Execution: Use uv
Always use `uv` to run Python files. See [pyproject.toml](mdc:ingestion/pyproject.toml) for project configuration.
