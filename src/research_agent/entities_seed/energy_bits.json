It contains significant unsaturated fatty acids, essential amino acids, and phenolic compounds (e.g., salicylic and chlorogenic acids) that contribute to its antioxidant properties. Spirulina is used to enhance the nutritional and antioxidant profile of foods and is considered non-toxic with beneficial effects on bodily functions beyond basic nutrition. Its lipid composition includes monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, free sterols, triacylglycerols, and phospholipids, which may contribute to its biological activities.\n- **Chlorella**: Not directly detailed in the provided notes, but generally known as a green microalga with a similar profile to spirulina, often used for its protein, chlorophyll, and micronutrient content.\n- **Phycocyanin**: A pigment-protein complex found in spirulina, responsible for its blue color and known for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n- **Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)**: An enzyme with antioxidant activity, often present in microalgae, that helps neutralize superoxide radicals and reduce oxidative stress.\n- **Glutathione**: A tripeptide and potent antioxidant, sometimes found in microalgae, that supports cellular detoxification and redox balance.\n\n**Products**\n- Functional foods and supplements containing spirulina are formulated to improve protein quality and antioxidant content. These products are often targeted at individuals seeking plant-based nutrition or enhanced dietary antioxidant intake. Specific product details, pricing, and business affiliations are not provided in the current notes.\n\n**Businesses**\n- No specific businesses or brands are mentioned in the provided research notes. However, the use of spirulina in functional foods suggests involvement from health food companies and supplement manufacturers.\n\n**People**\n- No individual experts, researchers, or company representatives are identified in the current research notes.\n\n**Case Studies**\n- No specific case studies or clinical trials are referenced in the provided notes.

      "extensive_summary": "**Compounds**\n- **Superoxide Dismutase (SOD2/MnSOD):** SOD2, also known as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress. SOD2 requires manganese as a cofactor for its activity. Its levels decline with age, which correlates with increased oxidative damage and aging-related cellular deterioration. SOD2 is also used in cosmetic and personal care products for its antioxidant and anti-aging properties, including protection against UV damage and support for wound healing.\n- **Glutathione:** Glutathione is a tripeptide and a major intracellular antioxidant that works synergistically with SOD2 to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintain cellular redox balance. It is essential for detoxification and supports mitochondrial health by reducing oxidative stress.\n- **Manganese:** Manganese is an essential trace mineral that serves as a cofactor for SOD2. Proper manganese availability is critical for optimal SOD2 function. Metal substitution (e.g., iron replacing manganese in SOD2) can impair enzyme activity and increase oxidative stress.\n\n**Products**\n- SOD2 and glutathione are included in various dietary supplements and topical formulations, particularly those targeting anti-aging and skin health. These products are often marketed for their antioxidant benefits, though specific product names and pricing were not detailed in the provided notes.\n\n**Businesses**\n- Companies in the cosmetics and personal care industry utilize SOD2 in their formulations for its anti-aging and skin-protective effects.
