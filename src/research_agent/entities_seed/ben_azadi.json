Azadi's background includes years of experience in health coaching and public speaking, with a focus on empowering individuals to achieve metabolic flexibility and optimal health.\n\nBusinesses:\n- While the book is authored by Ben Azadi, there is no direct mention of a specific business entity producing the book. However, Azadi is associated with the Keto Kamp brand, which offers educational resources, coaching, and wellness products related to ketogenic living and metabolic health.\n\nProducts:\n- \"Metabolic Freedom\" is a book that serves as a 30-day guide to restoring metabolic health, healing hormones, and promoting fat loss. The book does not appear to be a supplement or consumable product but rather a comprehensive lifestyle and dietary guide. It is positioned as a practical tool for individuals seeking to break free from diet dogma and achieve sustainable health improvements. The book is authored by Ben Azadi and is likely published under his personal or Keto Kamp brand.\n\nCompounds:\n- The book discusses the use of ketogenic diet principles, fasting, and detox strategies. While specific compounds are not detailed in the summary, the ketogenic diet typically involves manipulating macronutrient intake (increasing fats, reducing carbohydrates) to induce ketosis, a metabolic state where the body burns fat for fuel. Fasting and detox strategies are also discussed as mechanisms to support metabolic health.\n\nCase Studies:\n- No specific case studies or clinical trials are referenced in the available research notes. The book is described as science-backed, suggesting it references scientific literature, but no direct studies or trials are cited in the summary provided.",
