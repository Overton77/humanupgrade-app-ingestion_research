He has a background in engineering and a personal history of battling multiple severe health conditions, including autoimmune arthritis, malignant melanoma, Lyme disease, and Bartonella. His experience with debilitating symptoms and limited success with conventional treatments led him to explore alternative therapies. Brad's expertise lies in both the technical engineering of health devices and the practical application of Exercise with Oxygen Therapy (EWOT) for chronic illness recovery.\n\nBusinesses\n- One Thousand Roads: This company was founded by Brad Pitzele with the mission to make Exercise with Oxygen Therapy (EWOT) accessible and affordable. The business is positioned at the intersection of health technology and biohacking, targeting individuals with chronic illnesses, athletes, and those interested in anti-aging therapies. One Thousand Roads offers engineered EWOT systems designed for home and clinical use, emphasizing science-backed, non-invasive treatments.\n\nProducts\n- EWOT System by One Thousand Roads: The primary product is an Exercise with Oxygen Therapy system, which allows users to perform cardiovascular exercise while breathing concentrated oxygen. The system is engineered to be more accessible and affordable compared to existing market options. It is designed to enhance cellular oxygenation, reduce inflammation, support detoxification, and improve immune function. Pricing and specific product details are not provided in the research notes.\n\nCompounds\n- Oxygen: The key compound involved in EWOT is concentrated oxygen. The mechanism of action involves increasing the amount of oxygen available to cells during exercise, which supports cellular repair, reduces inflammation, and aids in detoxification, primarily through the lungs. This approach is based on scientific research linking oxygenation to improved health outcomes, particularly in chronic illness and cancer prevention.\n\nCase Studies\n- No specific case studies or clinical trials were referenced in the available research notes. The information is primarily based on Brad Pitzele's personal experience and the scientific rationale for EWOT.",

      "extensive_summary": "**People**\n- Dr. Manfred von Ardenne: A key figure in the development of EWOT, Dr. von Ardenne's research demonstrated that enhanced oxygen intake during exercise can restore microcirculation and optimize cellular energy production (ATP). His work forms the scientific foundation for modern EWOT systems.\n\n**Businesses**\n- While specific business names are not mentioned in the research notes, companies in the EWOT space typically provide specialized equipment for exercise with oxygen therapy, including oxygen masks, medical-grade oxygen bags, and sometimes adjustable oxygen/hypoxic generators. These businesses position themselves as providers of wellness and performance-enhancing solutions for both athletes and individuals with chronic health conditions.\n\n**Products**\n- EWOT System: This product includes a high-flow, non-restricted mask, a large medical-grade bag (approximately 900 liters) for oxygen storage, and necessary connectors. The system is designed to be used with a separate oxygen concentrator (not always included) and fitness equipment. Advanced packages may offer adjustable oxygen levels, including hypoxic training options. Pricing and specific brands are not detailed in the notes, but the system is marketed for both athletic performance and general wellness.\n\n**Compounds**\n- Oxygen: The primary compound used in EWOT. Oxygen is delivered at high purity (typically 93%) and high flow rates to ensure maximal uptake during exercise. The mechanism of action involves increasing blood oxygenation, improving microcirculation, and supporting cellular ATP production. Oxygen is the active agent in all EWOT systems.\n\n**Case Studies**\n- No specific clinical trials or case studies were cited in the research notes. However, testimonials and anecdotal reports suggest improvements in vision, walking, cognitive function, and chronic conditions.

He developed the LEO System after recovering from autoimmune illness, leveraging his expertise in biohacking and functional medicine. Pitzele is recognized for his contributions to accessible, science-backed home EWOT (Exercise With Oxygen Therapy) solutions and is active in the biohacking and longevity communities.\n\n**Businesses**\n- One Thousand Roads: The company founded by Brad Pitzele, responsible for developing and marketing the LEO System. The business is positioned as a leader in affordable, home-based EWOT solutions, targeting both elite athletes and individuals with chronic health conditions. It emphasizes science-backed protocols and integration with other biohacking modalities.\n- Other EWOT Providers: Companies such as LiveO2, HyperMax, and EWOT Australia offer competing EWOT systems, with varying features, pricing, and target audiences. These businesses provide both basic and advanced EWOT setups, including adaptive contrast and altitude training options.\n\n**Products**\n- LEO System: A home-based EWOT system designed by Brad Pitzele. It includes an oxygen concentrator, large reservoir bag, high-flow mask, and tubing. The system is engineered for ease of use, affordability, and integration with other biohacking interventions. Sessions typically last 15 minutes. The LEO System is positioned as a foundational tool for mitochondrial health, energy, and cognitive optimization. Pricing is competitive with other EWOT systems, generally ranging from $1700 to $2300 for a complete setup.\n- Competing EWOT Systems: Products like the LiveO2 Standard Kit, LiveO2 Adaptive Contrast, and HyperMax EWOT system offer similar core components but differ in features such as oxygen flow rates, adaptive contrast capabilities, and suitability for athletic or brain protocols.\n\n**Compounds**\n- Oxygen: The primary compound delivered by EWOT systems, with concentrations typically around 90-94%. Oxygen acts by enhancing cellular respiration, mitochondrial function, and energy production, supporting detoxification, neuroplasticity, and inflammation reduction.\n- Supplements (stacked interventions): While not specific to the LEO System, users often combine EWOT with mitochondrial supplements (e.g., nootropics, nutrigenomics products) to target specific biological pathways for enhanced health outcomes.\n\n**Interventions**\n- Red Light Therapy: Frequently stacked with EWOT to amplify mitochondrial and cognitive benefits. Red light therapy supports cellular energy production and recovery.\n- Ketosis: Another common biohacking modality combined with EWOT. Ketosis enhances fat metabolism and mitochondrial efficiency, synergizing with oxygen therapy for improved energy and brain function.\n- Supplements: Mitochondrial and nootropic supplements are often used alongside EWOT to further support cellular health, energy, and cognitive performance.\n\n**Case Studies**\n- No formal clinical trials or published studies specific to the LEO System were found in the provided research notes. However, user and practitioner testimonials report significant improvements in energy, cognitive clarity, sleep, and recovery, particularly among athletes and individuals with chronic illnesses such as autoimmune diseases and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
