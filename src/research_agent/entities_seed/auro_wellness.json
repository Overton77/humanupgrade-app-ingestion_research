      "extensive_summary": "**People**\n- Dr. Nayan Patel, PharmD, is the founder of Auro Wellness. He is a pharmacist and researcher with expertise in glutathione and transdermal delivery systems. Dr. Patel has led over a decade of research into glutathione absorption and delivery, resulting in the development of Auro Wellness's proprietary technology and product line.\n\n**Businesses**\n- Auro Wellness is a health and wellness company founded in 2011 by Dr. Nayan Patel. Its mission is to create advanced health solutions that help the body function optimally and reduce the long-term impact of stress. The company is positioned in the supplement and biohacking market, focusing on clinical-grade, holistic health products, particularly those leveraging glutathione. Auro Wellness distributes its products through healthcare providers (MDs, dentists, pharmacists), Amazon, major book retailers, and its own website. The company has experienced significant growth, reaching over $4 million in revenue within four years, and benefits from a post-pandemic shift toward holistic and clinical health solutions.\n\n**Products**\n- Glutaryl and Glutaryl Plus are flagship products of Auro Wellness. Both are transdermal (topical) glutathione antioxidant sprays utilizing a patented sub-nano delivery system (Auro GSH™ Antioxidant Delivery System) to enhance absorption and systemic bioavailability. Glutaryl contains 20% glutathione (200 mg/dose), while Glutaryl Plus contains 35% glutathione (350 mg/dose). The recommended protocol is to use Glutaryl Plus for three months to boost glutathione levels, then switch to Glutaryl for maintenance. The products are pharmaceutical grade, with shelf lives of 18 months (Glutaryl) and 24 months (Glutaryl Plus) unopened. They are marketed for liver cleansing, anti-aging, detoxification, and overall vitality. Pricing details were not found in the research notes.\n\n**Compounds**\n- Glutathione is the primary compound in both Glutaryl and Glutaryl Plus. It is a naturally occurring tri-peptide amino acid, known as the \"Master Antioxidant\" and master detoxifier, crucial for neutralizing free radicals, supporting detoxification, and promoting cellular health. The Auro Protocol also incorporates Copper Tripeptide, which is designed to work with the skin's natural biorhythms to enhance wellness routines. The patented Auro GSH™ delivery system stabilizes glutathione and enables its effective transdermal and intracellular delivery, overcoming the limitations of oral and intravenous administration.\n\n**Case Studies**\n- Clinical studies referenced by Auro Wellness indicate that their topical glutathione system can reduce oxidative stress markers within four hours, suggesting benefits for managing oxidative stress-related skin conditions. However, specific study details, sample sizes, or published papers were not provided in the research notes. The claims made by the products have not been evaluated by the FDA, and the products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.",
